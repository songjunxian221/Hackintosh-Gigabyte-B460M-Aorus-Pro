**Note 1:** The BIOS version is F3, and there is no CFG Lock option in Setting, **So you should select the CFG Lock.efi in OpenCore Picker menu before you try to install the macOS.**

**Note2:** Windows10 WHQL can solve the problem of vague logo of mobo.

## README Before Install

- I set the model to iMac20,1, please change it if necessary, and you need to add Serial number, UUID and MLB by yourself.
- I have inject GPU0, Audio and Ethernet info in DeviceProperties, modify them if necessary after you login OS.
- In theory, this EFI is universal on each brand B460M motherboard, please solve the specific adjustment on your own.
- Be sure to read the above text **before using this EFI** to complete the BIOS settings, especially to unlock the CFG in the **OC boot menu**.
